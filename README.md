The CASH Music summits
======================

Each CASH Music summit will be a two-day event with an invite-only discussion day and a public workshop day that will feature industry experts from both music and tech.

We'll film talks from the discussion days, write deeper analysis, and use the events to learn and grow. Part hack day and part industry education, the workshop days will give musicians and technologists a place to learn, build new things, and test new ideas.
